# Poseidon  üî±iÔ∏è
## Intro
Poseidon is, to use a nice description by Reef, is an anti-framework. It's a a no-dependency, component-based Javascript framework for rendering UI on the web. It aims at being lightweight, fast, and intuitive (i.e. easy to use) for building static and dynamic apps without compromising on .....


### Goals
- Connecting to data sources should be easy, focus on the UI rendering bit
- More low, level, interface with the DOM
- Markup language via template literals, don't want to use JSX since this would require a build stage (i.e. to compile the JSX Javascript) and we don't want to deal with dependencies or configs
    a. Should be able to drop this as a script tag and start developing instantly 
- 


### Notes
1. Define unit of UI component via component class
2. UI should interface with data models to consume and update data (via lists and other things)
3. UI design should be declarative
4. Bind data or things that change within that component, keep virtual DOM to monitor changes 
    a. Diffing algorithm to figure out what's changed and render it accordingly
